I used the if [ $# -ne 1 ] condition to ensure exactly one argument is provided and the -f and -r flags to verify the file exists and is readable. I employed the wc -l command to count the total lines in the file and the grep -c command to count specific occurrences of "INFO", "WARNING", and "ERROR". To find the latest error, I used grep in combination with tail -n 1 to isolate the last matching line. Finally, I used the date command to format the report filename and redirected the grouped output into a new text file using { ... } > "$REPORT_FILE".
